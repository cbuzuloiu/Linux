Docker is one of the most popular containerization platforms, allowing developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. In this guide, weâ€™ll go step by step through installing Docker, pulling images, running containers, and managing them on an Ubuntu server.

## Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu

The best practice is to follow the official Docker documentation:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Once installed, confirm that the Docker service is running:
```bash
systemctl status docker
```

You should see `active (running)` in the output.

Verify that the Docker client can talk to the Docker daemon:

```bash
docker --version
docker version
docker info
```

If everything is working, youâ€™re ready to start pulling images and running containers.

## Pulling Images and Running Containers

Docker images are blueprints for containers. Letâ€™s pull an image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker image pull redis:5.0.10
```

### Common Image Commands

- List images
```bash
docker images
docker image ls
```
- Run a container from an image
```bash
docker container run redis:5.0.10
```
- Remove a Docker image
```bash
docker rmi redis:5.0.10
```
- If the image is in use and you still want to remove it:
```bash
docker rmi -f IMAGE_ID
```
- Remove dangling (unused) images
```
docker image prune
```
- Remove all unused images (not just dangling ones)
```
docker image prune -a -f
```

## Running an Apache Webserver

Letâ€™s pull and run the official Apache HTTP server image:
```bash
docker container run -P httpd
```

#### Breaking it down

- `docker container run` â†’ Create and start a new container from an image.
- `httpd` â†’ Official Apache HTTP server image.
- `-P` (uppercase P) â†’ Publish all exposed ports (in this case port **80**) to **random available high ports** on the host machine.

Example mapping:
```bash
0.0.0.0:32768->80/tcp
```

That means port **80 inside the container** is mapped to port **32768 on your host**.  
You can now access Apache at: `http://<host-ip>:32768`

To see what port was mapped:
```bash
docker ps
```

If you want to map a specific host port instead of a random one:
```bash
docker container run -p 8080:80 httpd
```

Now Apache will be accessible at `http://<host-ip>:8080`.

## The Docker CLI in Action
Here are some essential Docker CLI commands:

Testing the installation

```bash
docker --version
docker version
docker info
docker container run hello-world
```

Getting help

```bash
docker help
docker container help
```

Searching for images on Docker Hub

```
docker search debian
docker search mongo
```

Pulling images

```bash
docker image pull redis:5.0.10 
docker image pull ubuntu:latest
docker image pull mysql        # default tag is latest
```

Listing images

```bash
docker images
docker image ls
```

Running containers

```bash
docker container run -P httpd
# Equivalent to:
docker container create -P httpd
docker container start <CONTAINER_ID>
docker container ls -a
```

Getting a shell into a container

```bash
docker container run -it centos
```

Press `Ctrl + P + Q` to detach without stopping the container.
